<p><p>This is the 7th point on the graphic of the treble clef. This is no physical cache at this point, you need to solve the puzzle fbelow to find the cache co-ordinates.</p>
<p>The cache is a nano camo container with room only the tiny logbook. There is no pen, so please bring your own. Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.</p>

</p>
<p><p>This is a replacement cache for the original TC#07 in the Treble Clef series first laid out by the Sallilas-HarrisClan. The series was created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music.&#160;</p>
<p>As the theme is music, the puzzles were laid out in the form of a treble clef designed by Nognod who is very skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.</p>
<p>These caches can be solved by older children and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. Most of the cache containers are as big as possible and most can include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family.</p>
<p>The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each. Please forgive any "gaps" in the circuits; these exist solely to work around pre-existing caches, which you can also pick up on your way round, if you haven't done so already.</p>
<p>All caches are placed with kind permission of the National Trust.</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>

<p>Musicals are a combination of songs, spoken dialogue, acting and dance, intergrated as a whole performance. Although it overlaps with opera, ballet and other forms of dance, it is often distinguished by the equal importance given to the music, dialogue and action.</p>
<p>Music has been a part of theatre since ancient times, but modern musicals emerged during the 19th Century, including the works of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan in Britain and Harrigan and Hart in America, and these then lead to groundbreaking works, such as "Showboat" and "Oklahoma!" and later iconic shows, such as "West Side Story", "Les Miserables" and "Phantom of the Opera". The most famous venues for musicals are the West End of London and Broadway in New York.<br>

<blockquote>Solved these over the last few days as I knew I was heading in this direction today.

Decided I was going to complete the loop in two hits, from different directions.

A nice easy find, I was concerned it might take a while when I read the hint!

A few nettles and brambles to avoid, glad I wasn't in shorts!

Many thanks for the cache.</blockquote>
