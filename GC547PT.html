<p><p>This is the 23rd point on the graphic of the treble clef. This is no physical cache at this point. To find the cache, you need to solve the puzzle for Treble Clef #23 to get the cache co-ordinates<br></p>
<p>.The cache is a micro container with room for just the logbook. There is no pen, so please bring your own.<br></p>
<p>Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.</p>

</p>
<p><p>I began with the PuCK Butterfly series and wanted to create more, so here is the Treble Clef Series. It has been created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music. I have tried to include a wide range of styles, but I apologise if your personal favourite is not included.<br></p>
<p>As the theme is music, the most obvious symbol to use seemed to be the treble clef, so I set about asking the extremely helpful nognod to create it for me, as he is skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.<br></p>
<p>These caches can be solved by older kids and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones, I'm afraid, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. But as usual, all of our cache containers will be as big as possible and most will include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family.<br></p>
<p>The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each. Please forgive any "gaps" in the circuits; these exist solely because I've had work around pre-existing caches, which you can also pick up on your way round, if you haven't done so already.<br></p>
<p>All caches are placed with kind permission of the National Trust.<br></p>
<p>Enjoy!<br></p>

<blockquote>Nice easy find to begin the last loop to complete the treble clef. Interestingly, we found two caches there... Don't know if one got lost! In doubt, signed both. TFTC! </blockquote>

<blockquote>Have now solved Loops 2 and 3, and today seemed a good chance to get the latter. Enjoyed the more difficult puzzles - none too difficult, all raised a smile and generally had me humming a tune or two from the cache page as I solved them. This one a good example of that, although I did lapse off onto a certain Coldplay track at one point.... [;)]  Set off from the appointed parking to this one in lovely sunshine - a chilly 2 degrees but in the sun and out of the wind (and with several layers on) very pleasant indeed. Made a meal of the find - got stuck on 2 likely places, but on widening my search the cache was soon found. TFTC!

<blockquote>*Had to come over this way today so took the opportunity to re-visit this recent DNF that stopped us from completing the TC series a few weeks back. We had exchanged a few messages with the CO and he provided us with a further useful hint to narrow the search down to a &#8216;side&#8217;.*

**It was a quick find this time with the vital piece of knowledge, admin complete and replaced as found. Really glad to get this one ticked off the list and GeoArt looks great on the map with all smileys &#128515;**

#Awarding a favourite token on this one for the whole series which was very much enjoyed#

Thanks to **Shanghai Joe** for placing this cache for our enjoyment.
