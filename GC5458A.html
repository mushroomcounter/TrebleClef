<p><p>This is the 8th point on the graphic of the treble clef. This is no physical cache at this point. To find the cache, you need to solve the puzzle for Treble Clef #8 to get the cache co-ordinates.<br></p>
<p>The cache is a small container with room for a few swappables and the logbook. There is no pen, so please bring your own.<br>
Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.</p>

</p>
<p><p>I began with the PuCK Butterfly series and wanted to create more, so here is the Treble Clef Series. It has been created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music. I have tried to include a wide range of styles, but I apologise if your personal favourite is not included.<br></p>
<p>As the theme is music, the most obvious symbol to use seemed to be the treble clef, so I set about asking the extremely helpful nognod to create it for me, as he is skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.<br></p>
<p>These caches can be solved by older kids and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones, I'm afraid, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. But as usual, all of our cache containers will be as big as possible and most will include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family.<br></p>
<p>The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each. Please forgive any "gaps" in the circuits; these exist solely because I've had to work around pre-existing caches, which you can also pick up on your way round, if you haven't done so already.<br></p>
<p>All caches are placed with kind permission of the National Trust.<br></p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>
<br></p>
<h3><strong>Year of the Rat</strong></h3>

<p>Additional Waypoints</p>PK5458A - Parking<br>N 50&#176; 51.928 W 000&#176; 09.875<br>There is car parking available along Waterhall Road in lay-bys and at certain points along one side of the road, but please don't block the road and be careful not to park on the double yellow lines, as this circuit can take up to two hours. It may be worth a little research before you leave home as well, because if there is a sporting event on at the ground, you may arrive to find it is very difficult to park at all.<br></p>

<blockquote>Tricky Find coming at it from the wrong direction as it were because it&#8217;s not actually a small. More micro now anyway. Missed it on first essay; Mr AnT got it second time around. A bit prickly 

Many thanks for setting this cache for us to find !

<blockquote>Despite the weather there was plenty of birdlife around and singing today. Pheasant aplenty, plus many small birds in the trees and bushes. Plus a Buzzard quite close at one point. Another easy find. Just had to be discrete to avoid the gaze of the dog walkers across the fence. TFTC!
