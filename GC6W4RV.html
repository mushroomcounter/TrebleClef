<p>This is the 24th point on the treble clef graphic. This is no physical cache at this point, you need to solve the puzzle below to find the cache co-ordinates. The cache is a nano camo container with room only for a small logbook. There is no pen, so please bring your own. Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.
</p>
<p>This is a replacement cache for the original TC#24 in the Treble Clef series first laid out by the Sallilas-HarrisClan. The series was created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music. In keeping with the themes the puzzles were laid out in the form of a treble clef designed by Nognod who is very skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.<br>
<br>
These caches can be solved by older children and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones,, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. most of the cache containers are as big as possible and most can include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family. The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each.<br>
<br>
All the caches have been placed with kind permission from the National Trust.<br>
<br>
<p>Enjoy!<br></p>

<p>The Bees Gees were a pop music group that formed in 1958, and consisted of 3 brothers Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb. The trio were very successful as performers and songwriters. They sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies, especially geared for Robin's vibratto and Barry's falsetto. They wrote all their own hits, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists. They were born and lived on the Isle of Man, England, before moving to Australia and then back to England to promote their career.<br></p>
<p>Solve the anagrams of some of the Bees Gees songs and then work out the letters you need to solve the final co-ords.<br>

<blockquote>Replaced this cache as it has disappeared..there was some new water pipework close to GZ. 

But we think it may have been taken off by an animal.
CO informed.

All good now.

<blockquote>No luck for us. We looked everywhere we thought it could be without any success. The very spiky bush was home to a bird nest, but no cache :(</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another nice puzzle quickly decoded, although I admit I had to look one of the anagrams up. Having had a quick look at #35 with no success I arrived at this one after a bit of a climb, causing a bit of over-heating in the layers worn today (but for which I was soon to be grateful). At GZ there is an area where snow has settled and I think the cache may be in there. Despite some clearing and prodding with a stick, no cache revealed itself. Ah well, a reason to come back! [:)] Thanks anyway! I could now see the weather about to turn and with 2 failures out of 3 searches almost turned back, but glad I pushed on through....
