<p><p>This is the 3rd point on the graphic of the treble clef. This is no physical cache at this point. To find the cache, you need to solve the puzzle for PuCK Treble Clef #03 to get the cache co-ordinates.<br></p>
<p>The cache is a small clip lock container with room for a few swappables and the logbook. There is no pen, so please bring your own.<br>
Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.<br>

<p><p>I began with the PuCK Butterfly series and wanted to create more, so here is the Treble Clef Series. It has been created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music. I have tried to include a wide range of styles, but I apologise if your personal favourite is not included.<br></p>
<p>As the theme is music, the most obvious symbol to use seemed to be the treble clef, so I set about asking the extremely helpful nognod to create it for me, as he is skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.<br></p>
<p>These caches can be solved by older kids and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones, I'm afraid, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. But as usual, all of our cache containers will be as big as possible and most will include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family.<br></p>
<p>The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each. Please forgive any "gaps" in the circuits; these exist solely because I've had to work around pre-existing caches, which you can also pick up on your way round, if you haven't done so already.<br></p>
<p>All caches are placed with kind permission of the National Trust.<br></p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>

<h3><strong>Ragtime Medley</strong></h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>Ragtime is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its main characteristic trait is its syncopated, or 'ragged' rhythm.</p>
<center><br>
<p>Scott Joplin was the most famous composer of ragtime music. He was born in 1867 (or 68), and died in 19<strong>F</strong>7.<br></p>
<p>He wrote many rags, including 'The Maple Leaf Rag' in 1899 and 'The Entertainer', which was first published in 19<strong>HJ</strong>, and later used in the film 'The Sting' which was released in 197<strong>E</strong>.<br></p>
<p>Along with Scott Joplin, Joseph Lamb and James Scott are generally acknowledged as the three most sophisticated ragtime composers.</p>
<p>Joseph Lamb was born in 1887 and died in 196<strong>G</strong>. He wrote many rags, including "Reindeer:Ragtime Two Step" in 191<strong>A</strong>.<br></p>
<p>James Scott also wrote many rags, including "Frog Legs Rag" in 190<strong>K</strong>, "Climax Rag" in 191<strong>D</strong> and "Broadway Rag" in 19<strong>BC</strong>.<br>

<p>Additional Waypoints</p>PK5452W - Parking<br>N 50&#176; 51.928 W 000&#176; 09.875<br>There is car parking available along Waterhall Road in lay-bys and at certain points along one side of the road, but please don't block the road and be careful not to park on the double yellow lines, as this circuit can take up to two hours. It may be worth a little research before you leave home as well, because if there is a sporting event on at the ground, you may arrive to find it is very difficult to park at all.<br></p>

<blockquote>Solved these over the last few days as I knew I was heading in this direction today.

Decided I was going to complete the loop in two hits, from different directions.

I took a while here, looked at the previous logs and moved around a bit, but sadly no joy today.

Many thanks for the cache.</blockquote>

Many thanks for setting this cache for us to find !

Replaced soaking log and bag and replaced somewhere not so likely to be in a puddle one day.
