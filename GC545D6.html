<p><p>This is the 14th point on the graphic of the treble clef. This is no physical cache at this point. To find the cache, you need to solve the puzzle for Treble Clef #14 to get the cache co-ordinates.<br></p>
<p>The cache is a small camo container with room for a few swappables and the logbook. There is no pen, so please bring your own.<br>
Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.<br>

<p><p>I began with the PuCK Butterfly series and wanted to create more, so here is the Treble Clef Series. It has been created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music. I have tried to include a wide range of styles, but I apologise if your personal favourite is not included.<br></p>
<p>As the theme is music, the most obvious symbol to use seemed to be the treble clef, so I set about asking the extremely helpful nognod to create it for me, as he is skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.<br></p>
<p>These caches can be solved by older kids and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones, I'm afraid, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. But as usual, all of our cache containers will be as big as possible and most will include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family.<br></p>
<p>Numbers 12-22 are set out on a wheelchair route, but some assistance may be needed to actually retrieve the caches.<br></p>
<p>The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each. Please forgive any "gaps" in the circuits; these exist solely because I've had to work around pre-existing caches, which you can also pick up on your way round, if you haven't done so already.<br></p>
<p>All caches are placed with kind permission of the National Trust.<br></p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>
<br></p>

<blockquote>We were not able to park in the main car park so came back down the hill and parked close to this one, which gave me a chance to find this one and the next on the series as we walked back up to join the rest of our party. A quick find here.

Another stretch of the South Downs Way with some friends. A misty start to the day, which didn't clear until early afternoon. Thanks to Shanghai Joe for the cache.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We had loads of fun solving all the puzzles for this series while we were stuck in quarantine back in October.

We managed to continue our search on the 2nd circle of this series, despite it being so cold and windy. But it was a nice day out. 

Nice easy cache! Tftc</blockquote>
