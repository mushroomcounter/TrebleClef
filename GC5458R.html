<p><p>This is the 9th point on the graphic of the treble clef. This is no physical cache at this point. To find the cache, you need to solve the puzzle for Treble Clef #09 to get the cache co-ordinates.<br></p>
<p>The cache is a small clip lock container with room for a few swappables and the logbook. There is no pen, so please bring your own.<br>
Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.</p>

<p><p>I began with the PuCK Butterfly series and wanted to create more, so here is the Treble Clef Series. It has been created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music. I have tried to include a wide range of styles, but I apologise if your personal favourite is not included.<br></p>
<p>As the theme is music, the most obvious symbol to use seemed to be the treble clef, so I set about asking the extremely helpful nognod to create it for me, as he is skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.<br></p>
<p>These caches can be solved by older kids and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones, I'm afraid, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. But as usual, all of our cache containers will be as big as possible and most will include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family.<br></p>
<p>The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each. Please forgive any "gaps" in the circuits; these exist solely because I've had to work around pre-existing caches, which you can also pick up on your way round, if you haven't done so already.<br></p>
<p>All caches are placed with kind permission of the National Trust.<br>
Answer</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>

<h3><strong>It's Still Rock 'n' Roll To Me</strong></h3>

<p>Additional Waypoints</p>PK5458R - Parking<br>N 50&#176; 51.928 W 000&#176; 09.875<br>There is car parking available along Waterhall Road in lay-bys and at certain points along one side of the road, but please don't block the road and be careful not to park on the double yellow lines, as this circuit can take up to two hours. It may be worth a little research before you leave home as well, because if there is a sporting event on at the ground, you may arrive to find it is very difficult to park at all.<br></p>

<blockquote>Solved these over the last few days as I knew I was heading in this direction today.

Decided I was going to complete the loop in two hits, from different directions.

This was the second to look for on part B !

A few hint items, but selected the correct one. After looking in the wrong place for a while - suddenly the penny dropped, of course, why did I not start there!!

Many thanks for the cache.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Worried that it might get busy here, but again any dog walkers were a good distance away, and the vans parked nearby seemed empty so no issues. Cache easily spotted. Replaced with a bit of extra camo to keep it safe. TFTC!

<blockquote>*With a lot more spare time on our hands now for obvious reasons we&#8217;ve been able to spend time getting through our &#8216;to solve&#8217; pile of mystery caches.  We&#8217;ve wanted for a while now to boost our find stats on this cache type. We had solved the majority of these last summer with the plan to get out in the nice weather to collect, this just didn&#8217;t happen and we have only just finished solving the last few last week. All the puzzles were solved with relative ease. Starting with TC#1 today and was our 100 mystery find which was not planned but a nice touch. Terrain was overall good, weather on the other hand was windy and we even had a short spell of hail stone towards the end of the walk. Today we completed 2/3 of the loops, all found with no DNF&#8217;s for the day. Picked up some other random hides along route. We&#8217;ll be back next week to complete the 3rd and final leg of this series.*

**Quick pick up here and a good size container, admin complete and replaced as found**

Thanks to **Shanghai Joe** for placing this cache for our enjoyment.
