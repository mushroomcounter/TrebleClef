<p><p>The cache is a small-medium clip lock container with room for a few swappables and the logbook. There is no pen, so please bring your own.<br></p>
<p>This is the 35th point on the graphic of the treble clef. This is no physical cache at this point. To find the cache, you need to solve the puzzle for Treble Clef #35 to get the cache co-ordinates.<br></p>
<p>Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.</p>

</p>
<p><p>I began with the PuCK Butterfly series and wanted to create more, so here is the Treble Clef Series. It has been created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music. I have tried to include a wide range of styles, but I apologise if your personal favourite is not included.<br></p>
<p>As the theme is music, the most obvious symbol to use seemed to be the treble clef, so I set about asking the extremely helpful nognod to create it for me, as he is skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.<br></p>
<p>These caches can be solved by older kids and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones, I'm afraid, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. But as usual, all of our cache containers will be as big as possible and most will include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family.<br></p>
<p>The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each. Please forgive any "gaps" in the circuits; these exist solely because I've had work around pre-existing caches, which you can also pick up on your way round, if you haven't done so already.<br></p>
<p>All the caches have been placed with kind permission from the National Trust.<br></p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>
<br></p>
<h3><strong>Animal Attraction</strong></h3>
<p>This is a multi-layered puzzle. First, find a connection between songs by these artists. Having found the connection, you then need to work out the "positions" which will then help you to work out the final solution to the puzzle for the final cache co-ordinates before you leave home.<br></p>
<p>If you wish to check your puzzle answers with me before going to collect the cache, please contact me through my geocaching profile and I will happily confirm if you have solved the puzzle correctly to save you a partly wasted trip.<br></p>

We solved all of these back in October when we were stuck indoors for mandatory quarantine after moving to Brighton from Australia. They kept us entertained!

Thank you for helping us discover Devil&#8217;s Dyke. </blockquote>

<blockquote>I got the theme here almost immediately due to some good knowledge of the kind of era these songs are from. [;)] Then it was mostly about figuring out what to do with that theme, which again didn't take long but did teach me something I did not know. [:D] I'd had a quick look for this earlier today but the GPS insistently sent me to what I now know to be the wrong place. Because doing it in order the GPS sends me to exactly the right spot for a quick find once the muggles who converged here at the same time as me had passed by. Picked up the Signal TB to move on. Thanks for some really enjoyable puzzles and another nice walk today. Have a Fave point. Will be back for Loop 2 next time I find myself down this way. For the record, I made this loop a bit over 3 miles, but under 5km. Took me nearly two hours but lots of that time was dodging muggles at GZs and a couple of fruitless searches, so could have been done a fair bit quicker than that. TFTC!

<blockquote>*We&#8217;ve return to complete our 3rd and final loop of this series today. Weather not looking the best but can&#8217;t be too fussy when being in Lockdown. This loop was probably the most challenging in terrain with its ups and downs but no issues in walking round. Very quiet up here with only a few passing horses. As always when completing a series we come a cropper on one of them and on this occasion it was #23, gave it two goes but had to admit defeat. We&#8217;ll return another day. Very enjoyable series right on our doorstep.*

**Took a bit of searching this one, it wasn&#8217;t helped by searching the wrong side first. Slippery embankments but got up and found the hide in the end, admin complete and replaced as found**

#Horus Frog TB off here for an onwards journey#

Thanks to **Shanghai Joe** for placing this cache for our enjoyment.
