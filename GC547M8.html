<p><p>This is the 22nd point on the graphic of the treble clef. This is no physical cache at this point. To find the cache, you need to solve the puzzle for Treble Clef #22 to get the cache co-ordinates.<br></p>
<p>The cache is a small container with only room for a tiny swappable and the logbook. There is no pen, so please bring your own.<br></p>
<p>Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.</p>

<p><p>I began with the PuCK Butterfly series and wanted to create more, so here is the Treble Clef Series. It has been created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music. I have tried to include a wide range of styles, but I apologise if your personal favourite is not included.<br></p>
<p>As the theme is music, the most obvious symbol to use seemed to be the treble clef, so I set about asking the extremely helpful nognod to create it for me, as he is skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.<br></p>
<p>These caches can be solved by older kids and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones, I'm afraid, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. But as usual, all of our cache containers will be as big as possible and most will include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family.<br></p>
<p>Numbers 12-22 are set out on a wheelchair route, but some assistance may be needed to actually retrieve the caches.<br></p>
<p>The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each. Please forgive any "gaps" in the circuits; these exist solely because I've had work around pre-existing caches, which you can also pick up on your way round, if you haven't done so already.<br></p>
<p>All caches are placed with kind permission of the National Trust.<br></p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>
<br></p>
<h3><strong>Man In The Mirror</strong></h3>
<br>
<p>Michael Joseph Jackson (1958-2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer and actor, who was often referred to as the "King of Pop". He started his career as the youngest member of The Jackson 5 in 1964 and began his solo career in 1971. He was a very popular and a dominant figure in pop during the 1980s and was dedicated to bringing down racial barriers. Much of his personal life created controversy, but he continued to be successful until his death in 2009, and has even had new postumous hits recorded before his death and previously unused.<br>

<p>Additional Waypoints</p>PK547M8 - Parking<br>N 50&#176; 51.840 W 000&#176; 11.100<br>There is car parking at several places along this road. These are the co-ordinates for the first of them at the very beginning of this circular walk. This walk has been designed for use by people in wheelchairs. The first cache would be a challenge unless you have someone else with you, but the remainder should all be accessible from a wheelchair.<br></p>

<blockquote>And suddenly the last of this loop. Another straight forward puzzle quickly solved, and another decent hide quickly found (cracking hint by the way which is obvious when you get there). Thanks again for this whole series - which has now provided 3 nice walks. Today's joy was the return of spring birdsong - several Skylarks in particular today raising the spirits. Will be back another time for the few I missed. Meanwhile adding a Fave point here for this loop. TFTC!

<blockquote>We had loads of fun solving all the puzzles for this series while we were stuck in quarantine back in October.

Continued our search on the 2nd circle of this series, despite it being so cold and windy. But it was a nice day out. 

Nice easy cache! Saw some cute deer in the field nearby! Tftc</blockquote>
