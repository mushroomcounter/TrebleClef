<p><p>This is the 26th point on the graphic of the treble clef. This is no physical cache at this point. To find the cache, you need to solve the puzzle for Treble Clef #26 to get the cache co-ordinates.<br></p>
<p>The cache is a small container with room for a couple of small swappables and the logbook. There is no pen, so please bring your own.<br></p>
<p>Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.</p>

</p>
<p><p>I began with the PuCK Butterfly series and wanted to create more, so here is the Treble Clef Series. It has been created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music. I have tried to include a wide range of styles, but I apologise if your personal favourite is not included.<br></p>
<p>As the theme is music, the most obvious symbol to use seemed to be the treble clef, so I set about asking the extremely helpful nognod to create it for me, as he is skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.<br></p>
<p>These caches can be solved by older kids and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones, I'm afraid, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. But as usual, all of our cache containers will be as big as possible and most will include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family.<br></p>
<p>The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each. Please forgive any "gaps" in the circuits; these exist solely because I've had work around pre-existing caches, which you can also pick up on your way round, if you haven't done so already.<br></p>
<p>All the caches have been placed with kind permission from the National Trust.<br></p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>

<blockquote>This cache appears to have been missing for some time. Would the owner please check this cache and see if it still in place or give an indication of when it may be sorted out. Otherwise it should be archived. If there is no response to this log after 30 days I will archive the cache. In the meantime I am disabling it.

Guidelines:

* You are responsible for occasional visits to your cache to ensure it is in proper working order, especially when someone reports a problem with the cache (missing, damaged, wet, etc.), or posts a Needs Maintenance log. Temporarily disable your cache to let others know not to search for it until you have addressed the problem. You are permitted a reasonable amount of time &#8211; generally up to 4 weeks &#8211; in which to check on your cache. If a cache is not being maintained, or has been temporarily disabled for an unreasonable length of time, we may archive the listing.

Could the cache owner please place a note on the cache page so that other cachers and I can see what your intentions are. 

Please DO NOT send an email about this cache in case I don't receive it. Posting a note will ensure your cache does not get archived in error.
