<p><p>This is the 16th point on the graphic of the treble clef. This is no physical cache at this point. To find the cache, you need to solve the puzzle for PuCK Treble Clef #16 to get the cache co-ordinates.<br></p>
<p>The cache is a very small camo container with room for a few tiny swappables and the logbook. There is no pen, so please bring your own.<br></p>
<p>Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.</p>

</p>
<p><p>I began with the PuCK Butterfly series and wanted to create more, so here is the Treble Clef Series. It has been created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music. I have tried to include a wide range of styles, but I apologise if your personal favourite is not included.<br></p>
<p>As the theme is music, the most obvious symbol to use seemed to be the treble clef, so I set about asking the extremely helpful nognod to create it for me, as he is skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.<br></p>
<p>These caches can be solved by older kids and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones, I'm afraid, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. But as usual, all of our cache containers will be as big as possible and most will include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family.<br></p>
<p>Numbers 12-22 are set out on a wheelchair route, but some assistance may be needed to actually retrieve the caches.<br></p>
<p>The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each. Please forgive any "gaps" in the circuits; these exist solely because I've had work around pre-existing caches, which you can also pick up on your way round, if you haven't done so already.<br></p>
<p>All caches are placed with kind permission of the National Trust.<br></p>
<p>Enjoy!<br></p>
<h3><strong>Rapper's Delight</strong></h3>
<br>
<p>Hip hop, or rap music, is a genre consisting of stylised rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping - a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. The music also often incorporates other elements including scratching, DJing, beatboxing and synthesis. This genre developed during the 1970s in New York City, and later spread worldwide during the 1980s. The first hip-hop record is widely regarded to be The Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight" from 1979.<br>

<blockquote>I had a very brief look for this one on Sunday, but was walking with friends and didn't spend very long. Today I had another look but was then disturbed by dog walkers, so walked on to #17 before returning. My final search was of a different host and I soon spotted the container. Have a favourite for the series.

After two days walking on the SDW with friends I stayed on for another day to tackle the Devil's Dyke series, having enjoyed the original series many years ago. Found a few Church Micros on the way there. A partially cloudy day, quite cold at the start but warming up. Thanks to Shanghai Joe for the cache.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Oh dear. And it was all going so well. [:(] Spent a few minutes looking but just couldn't clap eyes on it, and the trickle of muggles suddenly seemed to be more of a deluge, so I gave it up to avoid being too suspicious. Will try again another time, maybe when 20 and 21 are available again too. Thanks anyway!

<blockquote>We had loads of fun solving all the puzzles for this series while we were stuck in quarantine back in October.

We managed to continue our search on the 2nd circle of this series, despite it being so cold and windy. But it was a nice day out. 

Nice easy cache! Great camo. Tftc</blockquote>

<blockquote>*With a lot more spare time on our hands now for obvious reasons we&#8217;ve been able to spend time getting through our &#8216;to solve&#8217; pile of mystery caches.  We&#8217;ve wanted for a while now to boost our find stats on this cache type. We had solved the majority of these last summer with the plan to get out in the nice weather to collect, this just didn&#8217;t happen and we have only just finished solving the last few last week. All the puzzles were solved with relative ease. Starting with TC#1 today and was our 100 mystery find which was not planned but a nice touch. Terrain was overall good, weather on the other hand was windy and we even had a short spell of hail stone towards the end of the walk. Today we completed 2/3 of the loops, all found with no DNF&#8217;s for the day. Picked up some other random hides along route. We&#8217;ll be back next week to complete the 3rd and final leg of this series.*

**This one had a fooled for a while, searched all potential hosts with hint in mind. We done a full circle and came back to the original host. This time we found a piece of wire on the host and searched the surrounding area and found the container on the floor, admin complete and replaced as best we could back to hint**

Thanks to **Shanghai Joe** for placing this cache for our enjoyment.
