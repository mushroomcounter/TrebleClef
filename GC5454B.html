<p><p>This is the 4th point on the graphic of the treble clef. This is no physical cache at this point. To find the cache, you need to solve the puzzle for PuCK Treble Clef #04 to get the cache co-ordinates.<br></p>
<p>The cache is a small clip lock container with room for a few swappables and the logbook. There is no pen, so please bring your own.<br>
Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.</p>

</p>
<p><p>I began with the PuCK Butterfly series and wanted to create more, so here is the Treble Clef Series. It has been created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music. I have tried to include a wide range of styles, but I apologise if your personal favourite is not included.<br></p>
<p>As the theme is music, the most obvious symbol to use seemed to be the treble clef, so I set about asking the extremely helpful nognod to create it for me, as he is skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.<br></p>
<p>These caches can be solved by older kids and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones, I'm afraid, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. But as usual, all of our cache containers will be as big as possible and most will include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family.<br></p>
<p>The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each. Please forgive any "gaps" in the circuits; these exist solely because I've had to work around pre-existing caches, which you can also pick up on your way round, if you haven't done so already.<br></p>
<p>All caches are placed with kind permission of the National Trust.<br></p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>
<br></p>
<h3><strong>I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues</strong></h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>Blues is a musical genre originating in African-American communities in the southern United States from spirituals, work songs and narrative ballads. Blues is characterized by specific chord progressions of which the 12-bar blues is the most common. Often notes are sung or played flattened or gradually bent to give it a very distinctive sound.</p>
<br>

<p>W.C.Handy was born in 187<strong>C</strong> and is widely known as the father of the Blues. "The Memphis Blues" was his first composition, written in 1909 and published in 19<strong>HD</strong>.<br></p>
<p>"Beale Street Blues", written in 191<strong>K</strong>, was composed as a farewell to the old Beale Street of Memphis, but Beale Street is still there and is considered the 'home of the blues' to this day - hence the lyrics in the Marc Coln song originally released in 199<strong>F</strong> "Walking in Memphis", which was covered by Cher in 199<strong>J</strong>.<br></p>
<p>Charley Patton, also known as the 'Father of the Delta Blues' made many recordings including "Rattlesnake Blues" in 192<strong>E</strong> and "Revenue Man Blues" in 1934.<br></p>
<p>The first commercial recording of vocal blues by an African-American singer was made in 19<strong>BG</strong> with Mamie Smith's rendition of Crazy Blues.<br></p>
<p>B.B.King, born in 192<strong>A</strong>, is a well-known American blues singer and guitarist who was nicknamed 'The King of Blues'. He combines many styles to make his own guitar style, elements of which have become indispensable components of today's rock guitarists vocabulary.<br></p>
<p>Muddy Waters (Mckinley Morganfield), considered 'Father of modern Chicago Blues, was a major inspiration for the British Blues explosion in the 1960's.<br>

<p>Additional Waypoints</p>PK5454B - Parking<br>N 50&#176; 51.928 W 000&#176; 09.875<br>There is car parking available along Waterhall Road in lay-bys and at certain points along one side of the road, but please don't block the road and be careful not to park on the double yellow lines, as this circuit can take up to two hours. It may be worth a little research before you leave home as well, because if there is a sporting event on at the ground, you may arrive to find it is very difficult to park at all.<br></p>
