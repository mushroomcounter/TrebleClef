<p><p>This is the 20th point on the graphic of the treble clef. This is no physical cache at this point. To find the cache, you need to solve the puzzle for Treble Clef #20 to get the cache co-ordinates.<br></p>
<p>The cache is a camo nano with only room for the logbook. Tweezers would definitely be an advantage! There is no pen, so please bring your own.<br></p>
<p>Please replace the cache hidden as found and let me know if any maintenance is needed. Thank you.</p>

</p>
<p><p>I began with the PuCK Butterfly series and wanted to create more, so here is the Treble Clef Series. It has been created using a theme that most people can find enjoyment in, in some form or another - music. I have tried to include a wide range of styles, but I apologise if your personal favourite is not included.</p>
<p>As the theme is music, the most obvious symbol to use seemed to be the treble clef, so I set about asking the extremely helpful nognod to create it for me, as he is skilled at creating shapes with co-ordinates. He is also willing to help others to create shapes of their own. If anyone wishes to do this, please contact him through his geocaching profile page.</p>
<p>These caches can be solved by older kids and teenagers, but will be a bit of a challenge to the younger ones, I'm afraid, and the puzzles do become more challenging towards the end of the series. But as usual, all of our cache containers will be as big as possible and most will include at least a few swappables, so the actual walks will be enjoyable for all the family.</p>
<p>Numbers 12-22 are set out on a wheelchair route, but some assistance may be needed to actually retrieve the caches.</p>
<p>The caches are set out in 3 separate circular walks of between 2- 4 miles each. Please forgive any "gaps" in the circuits; these exist solely because I've had work around pre-existing caches, which you can also pick up on your way round, if you haven't done so already.</p>
<p>All caches are placed with kind permission of the National Trust.</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br>

<h3><strong>Reggae Got Soul</strong></h3>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica on the late 1960s. It is a style of music that is strongly influenced by traditional mento and calypso music, as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues. One of the most easily recognised elements is offbeat rhythms, and the concept of call and response is also found throughout reggae music.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>This puzzle includes a lot of reggae influenced inspired hits, as well as those by well-known reggae stars.</p>
<p>Match the songs to the artists:</p>

<blockquote>Hi

Can the owner please post an update on this cache as it has been disabled for an extended length of time. Obviously, we give extra time when a cache must be disabled for reasons beyond the owner's control, but it does help to have periodic updates.

I will check back in 30 days and if there is no response to my log I will archive the cache.

<blockquote>*With a lot more spare time on our hands now for obvious reasons we&#8217;ve been able to spend time getting through our &#8216;to solve&#8217; pile of mystery caches.  We&#8217;ve wanted for a while now to boost our find stats on this cache type. We had solved the majority of these last summer with the plan to get out in the nice weather to collect, this just didn&#8217;t happen and we have only just finished solving the last few last week. All the puzzles were solved with relative ease. Starting with TC#1 today and was our 100 mystery find which was not planned but a nice touch. Terrain was overall good, weather on the other hand was windy and we even had a short spell of hail stone towards the end of the walk. Today we completed 2/3 of the loops, all found with no DNF&#8217;s for the day. Picked up some other random hides along route. We&#8217;ll be back next week to complete the 3rd and final leg of this series.*

**There does seem to be works in progress along this fence line with the other side starting to be replaced. With this side mainly collapsed and laying flat wasn&#8217;t overly confident cache would be in place. Luckily after a good rummage we found in the grass, have reattached to wire for now, admin complete and replaced as found**

Thanks to **Shanghai Joe** for placing this cache for our enjoyment.
